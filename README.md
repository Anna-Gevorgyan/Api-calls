# Api-calls

The software does Get, Patch, Post and Delete api calls and cheks if all the calls have been succesful. 

## How to use:
Run npx codeceptjs run --steps in the local terminal(or any other). 
Be carefull! In the first scenario I have given an Id of a user. By the time you run this code the user can be deleted.
